Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! In this classic game, you'll be competing against the computer to see who can make the best choices and come out victorious.

To play, you and the computer will each choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Here's how the game works:

Rock beats scissors: If you choose rock and the computer chooses scissors, you win!
Scissors beats paper: If you choose scissors and the computer chooses paper, you win!
Paper beats rock: If you choose paper and the computer chooses rock, you win!
On the other hand, if you and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie and the game is played again.

To make your choice, simply type "rock," "paper," or "scissors" and press enter. The computer will randomly generate its choice, and the winner will be determined based on the rules mentioned above.

Are you ready to test your luck and strategy in this classic game? Let's get started!
