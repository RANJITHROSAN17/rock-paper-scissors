Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎉
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! In this classic game, you'll be competing against the computer to see who can make the best choices and come out victorious.

To play, you and the computer will each choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Here's how the game works:

Rock 👊 beats scissors ✌️: If you choose rock and the computer chooses scissors, you win!
Scissors ✌️ beats paper 🖐️: If you choose scissors and the computer chooses paper, you win!
Paper 🖐️ beats rock 👊: If you choose paper and the computer chooses rock, you win!
On the other hand, if you and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie, and the game is played again.

To make your choice, simply type "rock," "paper," or "scissors" and press enter. The computer will randomly generate its choice, and the winner will be determined based on the rules mentioned above.

Additional Features:
If you want to spice up the game with additional options, we've got you covered! Here are the extended rules with lizard 🦎 and Spock 🖖:

Rock 👊 crushes scissors ✌️ and lizard 🦎.
Paper 🖐️ covers rock 👊 and Spock 🖖.
Scissors ✌️ cuts paper 🖐️ and lizard 🦎.
Lizard 🦎 poisons Spock 🖖 and eats paper 🖐️.
Spock 🖖 smashes scissors ✌️ and vaporizes rock 👊.
