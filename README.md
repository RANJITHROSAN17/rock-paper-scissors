# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! 🎉 In this classic game, you'll be competing against the computer to see who can make the best choices and come out victorious.

To play, you and the computer will each choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Here's how the game works:

Rock 👊 beats scissors ✌️: If you choose rock and the computer chooses scissors, you win!
Scissors ✌️ beats paper 🖐️: If you choose scissors and the computer chooses paper, you win!
Paper 🖐️ beats rock 👊: If you choose paper and the computer chooses rock, you win!
On the other hand, if you and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie and the game is played again.
To make your choice, simply type "rock," "paper," or "scissors" and press enter. The computer will randomly generate its choice, and the winner will be determined based on the rules mentioned above.

Additional Features
We have added two additional options to spice up the game: lizard 🦎 and Spock 🖖.
Rock 👊 crushes scissors ✌️ and lizard 🦎.
